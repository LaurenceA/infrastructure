# How to book travel with the university system

- Submit a funding bid to my supervisor and CC CDT director (Paul if you're in IAI CDT) and maybe also the CDT
	- Include a budget, ie a spreadsheet with columns for Item, Cost, Comments, Evidence/Links
		- The evidence/links should ideally come from the Key Travel booking platform
			- When using Key Travel, the declaration says that before booking you'll do X,Y,Z; you can click through it even if you haven't done those things yet as long as you don't book before doing them
	- Include a justification for why attending this will be beneficial to you
- Submit a [Global Travel request](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/default-b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b/a/13a50fd9-198c-4696-9229-35f3e00be00b?tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) to confirm you're not traveling into a war zone
- Once it's approved, book things
	- Book travel and accom via the [uni system](https://my.keytravel.com/uk/log-in?RedirectTo=/uk/my-travel/booking-online)
		- Note: uni funding cannot be used to pay for Airbnb; you can choose to stay at an Airbnb if you pay for it out of pocket
    - Note: you _can_ book hotels externally (e.g. via conference websites) but you have to pay for it with your own card and you can't get reimbursed until after the event. Some students say this is fine, my CDT admin person said this can be a bit messy
	- If you're paying for something like a conf pass, you need to have a call/meeting w your CDT admin person (Suzanne if you're in IAI CDT) to book it together (they use a corporate purchasing card for this but can't give out the credit card info)
	- Arrange insurance (for free) via the [uni form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGxAsewPYlVdIlvFNnGHHooVUOFNaME5COTFSWFJTWTlCUUJZWEZGUFFBSCQlQCN0PWcu&route=shorturl)
- Submit the second Global Travel request to be allowed to depart (no sooner than 2 weeks ahead of departure)
- During the event, take photos of receipts for food etc
- After the event, fill out the [MyERP form](https://myerp.bris.ac.uk/agresso/), make sure you select the budget code in the drop down, and attach the receipts
