#Pip virtual environments can get huge.  So we define a couple of commands
#to make it easy to put them in the $WORK/venvs directory.
#Specifically, the venv is setup in $WORK/venvs/dirname, where dirname is
#the name of the current directory.  This is obviously a bit flakey.  But
#is going to be sufficient in 99% of the cases.
